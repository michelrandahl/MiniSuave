# MiniSuave
Some beautiful code from the book "F# Applied" by Tamizhvendan S

Code is from the initial MiniSuave tutorial in the first chapter

cleaned up the code a little by adding explicit types and renaming some values.

*(Uploaded as future reference for myself to remind me what pretty code looks like)*
